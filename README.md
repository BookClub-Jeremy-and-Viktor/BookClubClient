# Project 3 | Book Club Client - Frontend

## Description

This project focuses on building a Web application (Frontend). 
We are having React SPA frontend, built with React, 
implementing all CRUD actions.

To see a list of available books and scheduled events the
user needs to sign up first and log in with his/ her newly
created credentials. After the login the user is presented
with a list of books and a list of events. By clicking on
the button “Books” the user has the possibility to create a
new entry in the list of available books with the
opportunity to upload images from the user´s computers and
place them as a book cover.

When the user clicks on the title of the book, he/ she can
edit, update the content of the book entry and change the
image of the book cover. The user can delete the book entry
from the list of books too.
The same operations can be performed with the list of
events, when the user clicks on the button “Events”, with
the exception of the image upload.
